<h1>Customer Policies</h1>

<p>
<h3>BGP policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customers must announce the largest possible aggregates of their netblocks.
<li>Netblocks must already be announced in the global routing table by another provider.
<li>Customers whose netblocks are shown in the whois.arin.net registry as being owned by another provider must submit a Letter of Authority (LOA) from that provider authorizing Rivien to announce their addresses on the global internet.
<li>Customers must have their own globally-routable ASNs.  Autonomous System Numbers are provided by <a href="http://www.arin.net/regserv.html">ARIN</a>.
<li>We will not accept netblocks that cannot be routed globally.  These blocks are specified in RFC 1918: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.
<li>Customers are responsible for doing their own traffic shaping.
<li>DSL customers will not run BGP.
</ul>

<p>
<h3>IP allocation policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customers must utilize IP addresses as efficiently as possible.  The necessity of address conservation is described in RFC 2050, which has guided this policy.
<li>Currently the access devices of DSL customers will be configured not to need public IP addresses.
<li>T1 and larger customers will be given a /29 (6 usable addresses) by default.
<li>T1 and larger customers requiring a netblock larger than /29 must submit a detailed network map describing the number of addresses needed, where on the network they will be used, and what they will be used for.
<li>After the initial allocation, customers requiring more addresses must provide an updated network map describing current utilization of all ip addresses, and how new addresses will be used. 
Additionally, customers must have inverse DNS addressing in place for their currently assigned netaddresses, and they must show utilization of 80% of their currently assigned addresses, which we will verify using ping.
<li>Rivien reserves the right to periodically assess a customer's address use by pinging their network, and adjusting their address assignment if they are under-utilizing their assigned space.
</ul>
